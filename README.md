# Kernel development project 
- Implement processes, thread, scheduler, synchronisation, VM, Virtual file system , Unix OS
- Use QEMU emulator to run and GDB for debugging 
- Kernel module which 
- Develop filesystem in linux kernel to detect files containing bad patterns 
- System call handle malicious cases and prevents memory leaks and unnessary memory allocation
- FIle encrytion, decryption in Linux using CryptoAPI
- Kernel locking, Producer-Consumer, Netlink sockets and throttling 
- Developed a kernel module which when loaded instantiates a producer-consumer work queue and a kernel thread to process the queue. The queue contains various job requests such as  Contenation of multiple files etc.
- Decipher process scheduling and understand effective capacity utilization under general and real-time dispositions
- Understand concurrent execution on SMP platforms through kernel synchronization and locking techniques
- Clock subsystem
- Process communication techniques through signals and IPC mechanisms
